(this program is incomplete), i am still learning how to code and run this in a better way
using random to use probability and the probability depends upon the teams interests regarding players in the auction that year
# data from iplt20.com
https://documents.iplt20.com/documents/IPL/document/2022/02/IPL2022PlayerAuction_List_Sets.pdf
i still need to tweak the bidding probabilities to bid and win players realistically
and i also need to make other sets to bid for the rest of the players to finish the game.
